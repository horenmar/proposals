\hypertarget{introduction}{%
    \section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

The C++ standard library provides a set of utilities to generate
pseudo-random numbers in a range of user's choosing. This is done
by applying a type that represents the desired statistical distribution
(e.g. \texttt{uniform\_int\_distribution}) with a type conforming
to the Uniform Random Bit Generator (URBG) concept (e.g. \texttt{mt19937}).

This makes the standard-provided facilities highly customizable, but they
are rarely used because the generated numbers are not reproducible
across different platforms. This paper proposes changes that would allow
users to use these facilities for domains that require cross-platform
reproducibility, such as testing, simulations, and games.


\hypertarget{motivation}{%
    \section{Motivation}\label{motivation}}

A straightforward ``Hello world'' of random number generation looks something
like this:

% https://godbolt.org/z/dB7H_2
\begin{codeblock}
#include <random>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::mt19937 urbg;
    std::uniform_int_distribution<> dist(0, 100);
    std::cout << dist(urbg) << '\n';
}
\end{codeblock}

On my machine, this code always prints out \texttt{53}. \href{https://godbolt.org/z/dB7H_2}{On other
popular platforms, the code prints \texttt{82} and \texttt{92}}. This
difference in outputs makes the standard-provided \texttt{<random>}
facilities unusable in contexts where a cross-platform reproducibility
is required, such as procedural generation and physics simulations.

However, cross-platform reproducibility is useful even in cases
where it is not required, such as property-based tests. For property-based
testing, it is desirable for a fixed seed to generate the same
test case across different platforms, so that developers can share
relevant seeds between themselves.

Because of this, \texttt{<random>} is currently unusable in many
domains and applications, and if we want to change that, we need
to ensure that a deterministically seeded code, such as the snippet
above, generates the same numbers on all platforms.


\hypertarget{possible-solutions}{%
    \section{Possible solutions}\label{possible-solutions}}

This section outlines possible solutions to the problem explained above,
together with their advantages and disadvantages as seen by the author of
this paper.

\hypertarget{standardize-implementation}{%
    \subsection{Standardize implementation for current distributions}\label{possible-solutions}}

One possibility (the one prefered by the author), is to mandate the specific
implementation of all distributions in \texttt{<random>}. This option
has two advantages in that it retroactively fixes broken code, and
also does not introduce further maintenance burden on standard library
implementations (unlike the later options).

The disadvantage of this option is that it can be viewed as a breaking
change and that it takes away the implementation's latitude to provide
the fastest possible distributions.

I see the backward compatibility argument as debatable, as at least one
implementor does not see the change to distribution output as breaking
unless it forces ABI break\cite{msvc-github}.

The second disadvantage can be fixed by adding \texttt{fast_meow_distributions}
to the standard, at the cost of also erasing the maintenance burden advantage
of this option.


\hypertarget{portable-overloads}{%
    \subsection{Provide \texttt{portable_meow_distributions}}\label{portable-overloads}}

The other possibility is to add \texttt{portable_meow_distributions}
to \texttt{<random>}. This option does not break old code that relies
on a platform's specific implementation and lets implementors write
the best performing code for distributions for their platforms.

However, it comes at the cost of increased maintenance burden (compared
to just standardizing implementations of the current distributions), being
harder to teach, and keeping existing single-platform code broken if it
becomes used in cross-platform contexts.



\hypertarget{non-goals}{%
    \section{Non-goals}\label{non-goals}}

Note that this paper does not attempt to fix other problems that make
\texttt{<random>} either hard or flat out impossible, to use correctly,
as that is the purview of different papers. It also does not provide code
nor wording, as those can be decided after we agree on the direction we
want to take.
